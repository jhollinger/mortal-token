* However, making it a thin wrapper around HMAC makes it much more secure, while making it slightly less relevant (why not just understand and use HAMC?).

** RELEASE 0.1.0 (08/03/2012) **

* Add config setting to change time units. Now works with :days, :hours, :minutes
* Add ability to use multiple configurations in the same application
